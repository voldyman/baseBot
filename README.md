#IRC Cloud bot

this project uses go lang's websocket library to connect to [www.irccloud.com](http://www.irccloud.com).

this is just a base bot and does nothing except connecting to the server and print the response (if debug mode is enabled). One could build more interesting bots using this as the base.


##To build

you first need to get the websocket module

    $ go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket

then clone this repo and cd to the code dir and use

    $ go build baseBot.go http_helper.go
    $ ./baseBot --email='yourEmail@here.info' --password='*****' --debug=true
